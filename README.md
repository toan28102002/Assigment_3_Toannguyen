How to use my code: Just put the code clone the code into Visual Studio and it automatically runs for you with the data that I already gave.

Files:
+ ExpressionManager.cpp
+ ExpressionManager.h
+ MyQueue.cpp
+ MyQueue.h
+ main.cpp

For part Infix to Postfix Conversion, you can input your Expression but for part 2 I already give the data, you need to read what it does and print it on the screen. 

The Assignment does not give specific calculations so I did whatever I could. (assumptions )
